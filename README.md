## Install

```bash
# Ubuntu based depenencies (Built in to the Makefile for ease of use)
`sudo make init`
```

## Usage

> The following make command will install all necessary files, log back in
> to your X environment choosing slacker as the Window Manager.

`sudo make install`

# Development

> The following utilities are what a C programmer using Makefiles targeting 
> the X11 environment will need for debugging and testing, and sanity.

1. `bear` => Generates a `compile_commands.json` file so your 
    language service provider will know what the hell is going on.

    - Install: `sudo apt install bear`
    - Usage: `bear -- make`

2. `Xephyr` => Allows the programmer to run the Window Manager in a nested X session
    so you don't have to log out , and back into the actual window manager.

    - Install: `sudo apt install xserver-xephyr`
    - Usage: `make embed`
