An X11 Tiling Window Manager for GNU/Linux and BSD's.

## Background

> Slacker Window Manager (swm) is a suckless-style X11 non-reparenting window manager.
> It is an attempt at creating a more structually sound and concise version of Dwm
> using straight forward C design patterns, refactoring as much spaghetti code as possible,
> and using explicit naming conventions. It also aims to ship out of the box with
> key features like a systray, status line etc..

## Install

```bash
# Ubuntu based depenencies (Built in to the Makefile for ease of use)
`sudo make init`
```

## Usage

> The following make command will install all necessary files, log back in
> to your X environment choosing slacker as the Window Manager.

`sudo make install`

## Development

> The following utilities are what a C programmer using Makefiles targeting
> the X11 environment will need for debugging and testing, and sanity.

1. `bear` => Generates a `compile_commands.json` file so your
    language service provider will know what the hell is going on.

    - Install: `sudo apt install bear`
    - Usage: `bear -- make`

2. `Xephyr` => Allows the programmer to run the Window Manager in a nested X session
    so you don't have to log out , and back into the actual window manager.

    - Install: `sudo apt install xserver-xephyr`
    - Usage: `make embed`
